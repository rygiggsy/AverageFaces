# Face Averaging - Creates the average face of the top footballers/celebrities. 

## Usage

### 1. Run face_landmarks.py to extract facial landmarks. 
```bash
$ python face_landmarks.py 
```

Note: Only the best(one) face detected will be kept. 
	
### 2. Run face_average.py to get the average face. 
```bash
$ python face_average.py 
```
	- This script includes face alignment so that all facial features will appear better, compared to naive face averaging without alignment.  

### 3. Sample results can be found as output5.png. Enjoy!
