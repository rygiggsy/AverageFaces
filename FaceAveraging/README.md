# Face Averaging - Creates the average face of the top footballers/celebrities. 
	1. Run face_landmarks.py to extract facial landmarks. Code has been changed so that only the best face detected will be kept. 
	2. Run face_average.py to get the average face. This script includes face alignment so that all facial features will appear better, compared to naive face averaging without alignment.  
	3. Sample result can be found as output5.png. Enjoy!
